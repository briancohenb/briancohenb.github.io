  <p>The state of housing in Syracuse is considered a crisis. The continuously increased cost of rent and spike in evictions have hit families living in concentrated poverty the hardest. Syracuse’s sole family shelter has been at maximum capacity for the past two years. A growing number of displaced families have been forced to couch surf, sleep in motels, cars or outside.</p>
  </div>

<p>Inflation in the aftermath of the pandemic has exacerbated homelessness. Families are left most vulnerable as family units are most scarce. Syracuse is <a href="https://www.syracuse.com/news/2023/12/syracuse-ranks-no-2-among-big-us-cities-for-child-poverty-even-as-rate-falls.html">ranked</a> second among large cities for child poverty. One in ten school children are homeless. <a href= "https://www.syracuse.com/news/2023/03/homeless-families-spike-to-never-before-numbers-in-central-new-york-its-such-a-crisis.html">About</a> 75% of Syracuse families now homeless have never been homeless before.</p>

  <h3>After the moratorium</h3>

<p>According to Alex Lawson, the policy director for<a href="https://www.cnyfairhousing.org/">CNY Fair Housing</a>, the cost of rent especially jumped after the pandemic. Landlords drove up prices in response to inflation and the end of the eviction moratorium, a policy that made it extremely difficult for landlords to evict tenants despite failure to pay rent.</p>

<p>Frustrated landlords had raised rent to recoup losses or even in an attempt to get rid of tenants who didn't pay rent during the pandemic. According to Lawson, many landlords and homeowners brought up their prices just because they could.</p>

<p>“There is rebalancing, sort of what happened for home sale prices. For a long time, sellers weren't really trying to find the market price; they were just listing for what they thought someone would buy. What happened during the pandemic, they kind of realized, ‘we can just list it higher than what we think is reasonable, someone else will buy it,’” said Lawson.</p>

<p>When the pandemic ended, government assistance meant to support people through inflation also ended. Communities already living in high rates of poverty were left with the inflated costs of living on low, stagnant incomes. The average market price of rent has gone up by more than $400 between 2016 and 2023 according to data from <a href= “https://www.zillow.com/research/data/”>Zillow</a>.</p>

<p>Of the 46% of Syracuse households living on less than $35,000 a year, a majority are “<a href="https://www.syracuse.com/news/2023/03/is-syracuse-too-poor-to-attract-new-housing-study-cites-obstacles-to-growth.html">cost-burdened</a>,” meaning they spend more than 30% of their income on housing. According the Jocelyn Richards, the director of Syracuse Tenants Union, the majority of tenants live paycheck to paycheck and are one costly life event away from nonpayment.</p>

<p>“If your housing goes up $400 a month, your income needs to go up by $1200 a month to keep that ratio. Increasing the cost of housing can have a real impact on the ability to maintain a standard of living,” said Lawson.</p>

  <h3>Instability</h3>

<p>The most affordable housing options are those in the poorest conditions. One out of three homes in Syracuse is considered “<a href="https://www.syracuse.com/news/2023/03/is-syracuse-too-poor-to-attract-new-housing-study-cites-obstacles-to-growth.html">chronically disinvested</a>.” Many of these homes are extremely old, left vacant and deemed uninhabitable by code enforcement.</p>

<p>There is a common economic model of some landlords to buy up these inexpensive properties and squeeze them for all they can. These landlords, referred to as “<a href= "https://www.syracuse.com/opinion/2020/12/syracuse-officials-must-stay-on-target-to-root-out-slumlords-editorial.html">slumlords</a>,” refuse to make necessary fixes to the home when tenants ask because the cost of repair usually outweighs the profit from rent. This could mean a drafty window is left unfixed, freezing up the home in the cold winter. Or lead-covered walls are not painted over and families are exposed to lead poisoning.</p>

<p>The majority of tenants rent month to month so landlords can push them out at any time. This may be done in retaliation if the tenant complains to Code Enforcement about the condition of the home. A lot of tenants don't know that retaliatory eviction is illegal so they may self-evict if they don’t know their rights.</p>
  
<p>Tenants who refuse to pay rent in protest to poor conditions left unfixed can be summoned to eviction court. It’s common for some people to not show up because the name “eviction court” sounds like they’ve already lost.</p>
  
<p>There is really nowhere else to go. According to the <a href="https://syracusehousing.org/">Syracuse Housing Authority</a> Executive Director William Simmons, there are over 2,000 people on the waitlist for public housing. It could take up to two years for a family to get off the waitlist. Thousands that qualify for Section 8 vouchers remain on waitlists.</p>

<p>An increase in newly constructed luxury apartments is another contributor to the increase in the average cost of rent. Although inaccessible to populations most vulnerable to displacement, luxury apartments may free up previously occupied housing.</p>

<h3>Concentrated poverty</h3>

<p>Zoning codes in Onondaga County restrict the building of apartments and affordable housing in wealthy suburban areas without the permission of municipalities. The approval process is complicated and is usually met with hostility from homogenous suburban residents fueled by the stigma around public housing.</p>

<p>The result is that apartments and affordable and public housing are built in confined areas, further concentrating poverty established from redlining and suburban sprawl. Outlying suburban areas usually have better opportunities, public services and resources. According to Lawson, there is a sense of protecting public resources for a small part of the public. These benefits are in turn segregated by income and race, feeding into the cycle of poverty. </p>

<p>“The problem in Syracuse is different from like New York City where it’s a housing cost issue, where there’s no housing, it's so expensive. Here the problem is really that people are so poor, there is such low income,” said Lawson.</p>

<p>The Syracuse Housing Authority has announced a <a href="https://syracusehousing.org/east-adams/">plan</a> to build more public housing and rebuild old buildings in the 15th Wards, the neighborhoods I-81 was built through. The project will create close to 1,400 new units and is designed to house residents of mixed-income to disrupt the concentration of poverty.</p>

<p>According to Lawson, building affordable housing in areas with more resources would better help alleviate the concentration of poverty. Not only does there need to be more government  investment, but more intelligent investment.</p>
